Remember: there is probably not one right way to perform any of those tasks.
Any method that you can justify and brings you intuition is good.
Pay attention to the capability to explain your findings. It sometimes affects
the modeling strategy too.

## your data source ##

the information you have to mainly use is from package
HSAUR2 and / or HSAUR3 and the package you can access
by typing in you R
> install.packages("HSAUR3")
> library(HSAUR3)
## require(HSAUR3) does the same, but library is better practice, since it does not fail silently
> data(Forbes2000)

## the tasks, please try to do at minimum four first. If you can not do that take some of the 
## tasks 4..10 to have four completed tasks in total

## Note: you can get lots of support from e.g. the instructor, if it seems obvious that you 
##       are trying to solve the problem.
##
## Note: you are more than welcome to form a community and share the information if you do it
##       so that everybody can access your tips/tricks and insight.

task1: investigate what the data is about?
 - what do you think the data columns mean
 - what kind of relations you can find

This does not mean that you have to learn business but use 
> data(Forbes2000) 
to check in your R (or similar in python) what the columns stand for. If you use python you can get the 
description from the HSAUR3.pdf that you can find from internet by googling HSAUR3 R package

task2: create a simple model to "explain" variable "marketvalue" and assume that all lines are coming from same population
tip: for example lm() can be used for simple model, then you put the marketvalue ~ other variables
     on the left hand side of so called "formula" that is like mathematical formula and works 
     as follows: "y ~ x + z" mean that y is explained by x and z variable in linear regression
     case one attempts to fit a line y = a*x + b*z and tries to find the parameters a and b so
     that the line appears to follow the data points. Please consult some literature for this
     it is unclear. The point is not to use (only) linear regression model lm() for the job
     but give an example hor those formula work. The other models in R tend to use the same
     way to describe the model structure and that is why it is worth understanding.

task3: find out is that true that all rows come from same population
  - why do you claim so
  - if they are not, what are the populations and why do you say so

task4: find out the important variables to explain the MARKETVALUE
  - what makes you think they are the right variables

  It is ok to do this in visual way if modeling or other variable selection seems to be too difficult
  to start with. Main point is that there is a good theory to say that this and this impacts the
  market value. The style is free. Good visual is better than bad model and good model is even better.

additional, non mandatory tasks:
task5: find a way to automatically find out the important variable
note: automatical does not require that you can automatically extract the
      variables so that machine can process them futher. You can also do 
      this 

task6: find out another automatic way to find out important variables


task7: find out the influencial samples (rows) of that that affect your model or explanation
tip: if you use lm() then so called leverage is one way to do this. Please check from
     some source how leverage is found out.


task8: investigate some distribution of any of numeric variables, what can you learn


task9: delete the contents of your R work-space (save it somehow before doing it)
tip: the saving is only important if you have not done that and are relying on 
     doing the analysis interactively in the R (that is not recommended)


task10: repeat your analysis to see what was missing in yout programs of scripts
